# Regex Tutorial - Matching an Email

A regular expression (regex for short) is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. Regex are more encompassing and dynamic compared to methods that require a direct match because you can find specific strings that encompasses what we desire throughout the whole text. Here are a few examples how we can use regex:
* Search
    * We can use Regex to search for specific patterns within a larger text

* Validation
    * We can use Regex to validate data. We can ensure that user input matches a specific pattern

* Extraction
    * We can use Regex to extract specific information from a larger text by capturing the patterns

* Text Manipulation
    * We can manipulate text by replacing specific patterns with other text/patterns
